<h3>Q1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions?</h3>
<p>
A website's frontend and backend are two separate components collaborating to produce a usable website. The backend is in charge of data storage and organisation whereas the frontend is what users view and interact with. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are used to build the frontend. On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, is made up of the server, which makes data available upon request, the application, which directs it, and the database, which compiles the data. Through middleware, the frontend communicates with the back end, which safeguards the data and answers the front end's inquiries.

<h3>Q2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.</h3>
<p>
An HTML tag represents the root of an html document and is a piece of markup language which indicates the beginning and end of an HTML element. They help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages.HTML tags have three main parts , opening tag, content and closing tag. They are the container of all HTML elements.
There are two kinds of HTML tags: 
Paired:- They require an opening tag that turns a formatting feature on and a closing tag that turns the feature off. Paired tags must surround the text you want formatted with that feature. Example : <b> ie bold tag.

Unpaired:-Unpaired tags work alone, and are usually placed before the text you want formatted. Example : <br> i.e. line break.

<h3>Q3. Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.</h3>
<p>
The virtual DOM is an abstraction layer, it provides a mechanism that abstracts manual DOM manipulations away from the developer, helping us to write more predictable code containing the elements of the react code. It does so by comparing two render trees to determine exactly what has changed, only updating what is necessary on the actual DOM. Like React, Vue also employs this strategy.

State changes in your application will be applied to the VDOM first. If the new state of the VDOM requires a UI change, the ReactDOM library will efficiently do this by trying to update only what needs to be updated.

For example, if only the attribute of an element changes, React will only update the attribute of the HTML element by calling document.setAttribute (or something similar).

<h3>Q5. Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.</h3>
<p>
Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
